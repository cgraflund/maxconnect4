Connect 4 program with AI that uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

Code Structure:
    main.cpp - Controls file input and game loop
    board.hpp - Holds data structure for board and functions for interacting with it.
    minimax.hpp - Holds agent and minimax algorithm for finding best solution.

Type 'make' in the console to compile. Run the executable using one of the following commands:
    Interactive: ./maxconnect4 interactive [input_file] [computer-next/human-next] [depth]
    One-move: ./maxconnect4 one-move [input_file] [output_file] [depth]
